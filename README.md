Welcome my Godot Test repo. This is where I will be commiting things that I am learning here.<br><br>

Everything I will have here will be put into branches. There will be explanations of each thing in the branches with steps
of whats go on in a text file. However, for reference in this readme I will have the youtube video that I am learning from.
