Hi and welcome to this tutrial. I am LunarKitsune(on github), but more commonly known as username as Cheesypockets most elsewhere.

I intend to make this tutorial not only for my learning, but for others who want to get into gamedev/coding.

As the name of the Repo suggests this project will use the Godot game engine. For coding I will be using C#<br>
However you may use Godot(.gd files) to code as well and it will more closely resemble a mix of python and bash.

This particular markdown file will skim over the basics of coding, and then the rest will be explained in other<br>
README files as the tutorial works more with different objects, properties, and interactive elements that we will<br>
be giving players. 

ðŸ”´However, I will give you resources just in case if you are going to use either C# or Godot, as well as a link to <br>
the Godot main page documents here:

1. [C# Basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/)
2. [Godot Game Engine Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html)
   - Latest version 4.4 as of the writing of this .md file on 7/9/2025
3. [Godot Language Scripting](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/index.html)
   - Yes still in the docs, but would rather put a direct link here as for easier reference.
  
With that out of the way we can get started...
