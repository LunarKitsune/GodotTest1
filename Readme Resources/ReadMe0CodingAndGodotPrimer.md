Hi and welcome to this tutrial. I am LunarKitsune(on github), but more commonly known as username as Cheesypockets most elsewhere.

I intend to make this tutorial not only for my learning, but for others who want to get into gamedev/coding.

As the name of the Repo suggests this project will use the Godot game engine. For coding I will be using C#
However you may use Godot(.gd files) to code as well and it will more closely resemble a mix of python and bash.

This particular markdown file will skim over the basics of coding, and then the rest will be explained in other
README files as the tutorial works more with different objects, properties, and interactive elements that we will
be giving players.

However, I will give you resources just in case if you are going to use either C# or Godot, as well as a link to
the Godot main page documents here:

 - [C# introductory programming by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/)
 - [GD Scripting (godot programming) documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/index.html)
 - [Introductiont to Godot Engine](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/index.html)

With that out of the way we can get started...

===== 01. Coding Basics =====

At the very least to start this tutorial and get to know how to read code
we need to know some coding basics. The coding basics I will go over are:
	<br>- Variables
  	<br>- Objects and Types
   	<br>- Functions
    	<br>- Control Flows
     	<br>- Classes (object frameworks)

===== Godot Basics =====
