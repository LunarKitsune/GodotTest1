Hi and welcome to this tutrial. I am LunarKitsune(on github), but more commonly known as username as Cheesypockets most elsewhere.

I intend to make this tutorial not only for my learning, but for others who want to get into gamedev/coding.

As the name of the Repo suggests this project will use the Godot game engine. For coding I will be using C#
However you may use Godot(.gd files) to code as well and it will more closely resemble a mix of python and bash.

This particular markdown file will skim over the basics of coding, and then the rest will be explained in other
README files as the tutorial works more with different objects, properties, and interactive elements that we will
be giving players.

However, I will give you resources just in case if you are going to use either C# or Godot, as well as a link to
the Godot main page documents here:

	C# Basics
	Godot Game Engine Documentation
		Latest version 4.4 as of the writing of this .md file on 7/9/2025
	Godot Language Scripting
		Yes still in the docs, but would rather put a direct link here as for easier reference.

With that out of the way we can get started...
